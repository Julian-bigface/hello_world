# hello_world
this is the first repository i created

i'm from china, it's a college student who likes drawing and playing games.
so, this means my dream obviously is making a game by myself.
it's far distant for me, because i never study how to program before,
today, it's the firstday i star my travel in github, to learn from the teacher in the internet.
